## Hi there 👋

I’m Rustan, a **Lead Software Engineer** with 10+ years of experience building web and desktop applications.  

I love working across the stack:
- ✨ Crafting smooth frontend experiences with **React** and **Next.js**  
- ⚡ Building reliable APIs and backend systems with **Node.js** and **GraphQL**  
- 💳 Integrating payments (Stripe and beyond) to improve real-world checkout flows  

Over the years, I’ve led teams, shipped features used by thousands, and thrived in Agile environments where collaboration turns ideas into working solutions.  

After **16 years in the corporate world**, I’m now exploring my own pet projects — building, learning, and sharing along the way.  

🐾 Fun fact: I’m also a proud **furmom**, balancing code and cuddles.  
💻 My previous corporate repos live at [@smlruco](https://github.com/smlruco).  
🚀 This space is where I experiment with new stacks and grow my skills through personal projects.  

Thanks for stopping by — let’s connect and build something awesome!
