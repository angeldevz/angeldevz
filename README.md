### 🐝 What I’ve Done
- 💳 Built end-to-end **payment systems** with Stripe (frontend checkout UI + backend intents, webhooks, and DB updates).  
- 🎨 Developed scalable apps (frontend: **React, Next.js, TailwindCSS** | backend: **Node.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL**).  
- 📅 Led **Agile ceremonies** (Sprint Planning, Standups, Retros) → boosted team vibes & efficiency.  
- 🐾 Managed a team of 9 engineers + testers → shipped features across multiple products.  
- 🔍 Conducted **code reviews** → higher quality, fewer bugs, happier devs.  
- 🚀 Spearheaded both **web apps** and **desktop UI features** that users loved.  
- 🤝 Collaborated with product owners & cross-functional teams → aligned roadmaps and delivered value.

- 💻 My corporate repos live at [@smlruco](https://github.com/smlruco).
